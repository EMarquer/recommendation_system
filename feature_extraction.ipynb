My experience is based on the pre stay experience I had with this company. My stay was supposed to be Oct 5-11 2008 I booked this Loft because 1st- was in Soho, 2nd the pictures looked good, 3rd the price was good, 4- I was contacted immediately. I never should have done it. They require you prepay on a credit card and sign a \\\"lease.\\\" I should have known better by the tone of the emails. Unprofessional, Lacking in tact or intelligently written. The terms of the contract are short. Basically (but vaguely) It says cancelation policy is within outside of 6 weeks prior to the stay a refund of 75% will be given back if re-rented. I didn't think we'd cancel. Well, after reading all of the horrible reviews on Trip Advisor and other sites - I canceled. I immediately emailed the 2 people I dealt with told them about the reviews. One review stated that they actually book private partys in the \\\"commom\\\" space and they can go all night. The guests aren't allowed to be in that space during the party. As well it said, the party guests use the same bathrooms as the overnight guests. Plus, the rooms do not lock. One reviewer even said the day he arrived his bed had been used and sheets were not changed. Gross! This was not the mature, private, clean and comfortable arrangement I wanted. In my cancelation letter I mentioned and asked if there would be parties booked. I recieved confirmation that there could be a party booked. I was contacted not by the original people who took care of me( we'll call them kevin/sales and James/rental agreeme\\ t)But by the Director of the Loft. After some correspondence, the Director, we'll call him Leroy, stated that he might have a private apt. I was very much interested in it and wanted details. It would be easier to just change locations instead of cancel. He didn/t get back to me. I had to be the one to initiate all communication each and ever time. Plus it took 3 or 4 emails to get him to answer. He finally, after a week said he found a place. I wanted details. After 3 days, still no details. He kept sending one sentence emails like \\\"don't worry\\\" etc etc. After 4 emails and 3 days of asking, I finally emailed and stated that I wanted the address and details of the place by end of day. He emailed back and said\\\" don't worrry, call me at lunchtime tomorrow\\\" I did what he said - he answered the phone and put me off.. again. He said he was busy and to call him around closing time. I agreed. However after all of the correspondence, unprofessional behavior, abrupt and strange emails, I decided to cancel. His response?: \\\"No problem\\\" I had since sent 2 emails asking the status of my refund. No reply. I have a feeling even if they did re-rent my space - I may not see my money. Very very shady. by the way, this location was found through VacationRentals.com which in itself does not have a good reputation according to reviews. Do yourself a favor, stay at a well known reputable hotel. It's worth it. As of now, I have booked a hotel for the week and will have to shell out another 2000K. The Soho Loft cost 299 per night plus tax.. ugh.\", \"author\": {\"username\": \"Princessdog9\", \"num_reviews\": 1, \"id\": \"D194FF21593550FE6FCBF76C7B270C3C\", \"location\": \"Orange County\", \"num_helpful_votes\": 8}, \"date_stayed\": \"August 2008\", \"offering_id\": 665814, \"num_helpful_votes\": 8, \"date\": \"August 29, 2008\", \"id\": 19513823, \"via_mobile\": false}\n\nNo match on this line:\n\n\nNo match on this line:\n{\"ratings\": {\"service\": 5.0, \"cleanliness\": 5.0, \"overall\": 5.0, \"value\": 5.0, \"location\": 5.0, \"sleep_quality\": 5.0, \"rooms\": 5.0}, \"title\": \"\\u201cGreat hotel - Great Staff - Great Value in NY\\u201d\", \"text\": \"Unfortunately, my work requires me to be away from my home, wife and children nearly three-quarters of the year. For the last 5 to 6 years at least, much of that time has been spent in New York at the Lombardy. I can't say enough good things about the hotel and its people. I only reserve the one bedroom suites, so I cannot comment on the standard rooms. The suites are all different and decorated to each owner's individual tastes. I like that. Some of the owners' tastes align with my own and some don't. If I am assigned a suite which is decorated too far out of whack with my sensibilities, I just ask to be moved. It is never a problem, and the front desk staff doesn't act offended, because everybody gets that I'm not saying it's a bad room,but rather, that it's just not to my taste. Not only am I always given a different room, if available, but it is always done with great courtesy and a smile. Try getting that at a chain hotel. The suites all have fully equipped kitchens. Yes, as others have complained on this board, the kitchens are small, and you have to bring your own coffee. Well, remember, this is not your home - this is an apartment style hotel and most apartment kitchens in New York are small. As for the coffee, I have to buy mine own at home too, so I'm OK with this. The rooms always have filters, so you just need some coffee. Otherwise, the kitchens are clean and fully functional. If a particular type of glass, bowl, utensil, etc. which you want\\ eed is not there, call housekeeping, ask for it and you will get it. The location on 56th, between Park and Lex is great. Lots of great restaurants nearby and very safe to walk around. Subway is just a couple of blocks away. Now, here's what really makes the Lombardy a great place to spend time and a great value - the people who work there. As I stated above, I'm away from home a lot, and I miss my family. No matter how many people you may know and see in whatever city you're working in, being on the road is lonely. I see that the folks at the Lombardy are sensitive to this fact, not just with respect to me but to all of the business travelers I see there. The guys at the front desk never fail to look up and say hello or quickly ask if I had a good day or dinner, even when I can clearly see they are busy with other things. The bellmen do the same. This is what my family does when I'm at home, and it make me feel better while I'm on the road, because I feel like somebody actually knows I'm there. It's basic human courtesy, and the Lombardy delivers it. While I am fortunate to know the names of many of the great employees at the Lombardy, I will not mention any here, because I will inevitably forget a few and, more importantly, do not want to gloss over the many, many folks working behind the scenes whom I never meet but know are also there working hard to make my stays so enjoyable. Lastly, I have seen a few posts on this board which suggest the Lombardy is no place for children. Not true. Like everywhere else I enjoy going, it is just no place for disrespectful little brats. Every year, I am lucky enough to get four to five days to spend with my family in New York in December. I have a three year old son and a nine year old daughter. The first time I brought them to the Lombardy several years ago, I was not sure what to expect, particularly since I forgot to mention I was bringing children when I made the reservation. They were treated spectacularly. Nobody at the front desk gave me the long face I so often see when I check into nice hotels with my kids in tow. Moreover, my daughter was not spoken down to, but instead treated with respect and courtesy (albeit the type you would expect in view of her age) just as any other guest. I have since had the good fortune to take my daughter back with me on several trips, and she loves the place. Several of the Lombardy staff ask me about her when I am there, and she asks me about each of them by name when I come home. The connection between the hotel and home significantly eases the burden of travel. My family is headed back to the Lombardy in December for a few days, and we already know it will be a great trip because we will be staying at a wonderful place in a terrific city.\", \"author\": {\"username\": \"Sgaffigan\", \"num_reviews\": 1, \"id\": \"5C2AA0F44CE9E4F152460DF3B1C91B25\", \"location\": \"Florida\"}, \"date_stayed\": \"October 2012\", \"offering_id\": 93583, \"num_helpful_votes\": 0, \"date\": \"November 23, 2012\", \"id\": 146028635, \"via_mobile\": false}\n\nNo match on this line:\n\n\nNo match on this line:\n{\"ratings\": {\"service\": 4.0, \"cleanliness\": 4.0, \"overall\": 5.0, \"value\": 5.0, \"rooms\": 5.0, \"check_in_front_desk\": 3.0, \"business_service_(e_g_internet_access)\": 3.0, \"location\": 5.0}, \"title\": \"\\u201cgreat value\\u201d\", \"text\": \"stayed at the Salisbury with husband and two teenagers. we booked a suite.
